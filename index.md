Hi there! <br><br>
    I'm Joelle Ramiandrisoa, a seasoned Salesforce developer/consultant with over four years of experience in Professional Services at Salesforce.
    I graduated from James Madison University in 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and minors in Mathematics and French. 
    I'm interested in both backend and frontend development. I have experience with Java, Apex, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. and am always interested in picking up other programming languages and technologies.
    I've worked closely with clients in a variety of industries, such as financial services, nonprofit, education.<br><br>
    Outside of work you can probably find me hanging out with friends, at a concert, roaming in NYC or in another city or country...
